# Sreekar's Clock
 
 A fairly basic Clock app for Android which fetches the current time and date from the user's time zone and displays them on the screen. The user can switch between the 12-hr and 24-hr formats.

An Android WebView was implemented to display a webpage with historical events based upon today's date within the app (This Day in History).
